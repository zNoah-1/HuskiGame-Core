# HuskiGame-Core
Public Minecraft minigame core made by Nua, mainly focusing on MC 1.8.8 at the moment.

This was initially made for HuskiMC (My server, not released) but I decided to make it public.

This is my first "big" project on Java (and on Bukkit-API) so code might be confusing, I'll try adding comments when I feel motivated to do so (Sorry). Also it's my first time using Github.

# Scope (At the moment):
- Managing worlds (Load, reloading and unloading worlds) using SlimeWorldManager 2.3.0
- Managing game matches (Start and end of matches, status and such)
- Managing special game events (Ex. Chest refill, worldborder shrinking, teleports, etc.), core should only manage execution

# Maybe list:
- API for Game events (Ex. Player leave, match start, match end, pre reload map, post reload map...)
- Utils for scoreboard

# Execution plan
I plan to finish the scope list and set it as "beta release", create a minigame plugin and if I feel like I should add it to the core instead, I'll add those features on it.
May recode in the future to improve readability (Code is a mess), not sure if add BungeeMode version into the recode.
